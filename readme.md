# Make My Room Talk

This project is an attempt to learn some JS by making my room talk!
I'm going to find a text to speech library in python, it looks like googles text to speech API can do that but I'm going to worry about that after I can get my html form to communicate with my python socket server.

## STEPS:

### 1. Make HTML form

### 2. Figure out how to play with that string when I submit it in JS
(I'm going to make it log it to console IK boring /:) 

### 3. Host a Flask Rest API and figure out how to POST to the thing

### 4. Make him talk (:

### 5. Fix Bugs and make it pretty and be infinitely happy that anyone can bother me when I'm coding now!!!!!!!!
